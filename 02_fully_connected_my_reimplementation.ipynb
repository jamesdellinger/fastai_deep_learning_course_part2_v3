    "# Forward & Backward Passes from Foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Last Time\n",
    "In the [previous notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jamesdellinger/fastai_deep_learning_course_part2_v3/blob/master/01_matmul_my_reimplementation.ipynb?flush_cache=true), we compared and contrasted techniques for implementing matrix multiplication from scratch. We saw that computation time decreased as we moved from using pure Python for-loops to broadcasting, and then we sped things up even further by employing [einstein summation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, and admittedly somewhat disappointingly, we confirmed that using the built-in PyTorch matmul method offered the fastest performance, thanks to the fact that it hands the operation off to the Nividia [BLAS](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/index.html), whose low-level routines have been optimized to perform linear algebraic calculations as rapidly as possible on Nvidia GPUs. The somewhat disappointing aspect of this is that we, as developers, don't have any vision into exactly what's going on inside Nvidia's subroutines. We have to take it at its word that it's doing things the best possible way, and while its speed would seem to indicate that this is the case, it still would be nice to be able to write our code in the language that the compiler will be interpreting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forward and Backward Passes\n",
    "In this notebook we follow the same pattern as the last and experiment with various approaches to implementing forward and back propagation for a fully connected neural network. We'll continue to use the [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset to observe how our code performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weight Initialization\n",
    "During the course of this notebook, I also embark on an exploration of the reasons why properly initializing neural network weight layers is so important. Much of my work is inspired by a [notebook](https://github.com/fastai/fastai_docs/blob/master/dev_course/dl2/02b_initializing.ipynb) that was covered during the [2nd lesson (aka \"Lesson 9\")](https://youtu.be/AcA8HAYh7IE) lecture of the 2019 fast.ai Deep Learning part II course.\n",
    "\n",
    "I show a series of simple experiments that illustrate the hows and whys of weight init, while touching on previous work done by [Glorot and Bengio](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf), and by [He, et. al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01852.pdf) Much of my work in this notebook served as a basis for a [medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/weight-initialization-in-neural-networks-a-journey-from-the-basics-to-kaiming-954fb9b47c79?source=---------2------------------) I wrote on the topic of weight init.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [2nd lesson (\"Lesson 9\")](https://youtu.be/AcA8HAYh7IE) also covered [this notebook](https://github.com/fastai/fastai_docs/blob/master/dev_course/dl2/02a_why_sqrt5.ipynb) that explored the history behind the PyTorch library's use of $\\sqrt{5}$, instead of the Kaiming paper's recommended value of $\\sqrt{2}$ when generating a Kaiming weight initialization. I omit this side bar from my discussion in this notebook, but suffice to say, we learned in our lecture that the use of $\\sqrt{5}$ was due to a long-standing bug that members of the PyTorch team throught worked better than the paper's default of $\\sqrt{2}$. [Jeremy's notebook](https://github.com/fastai/fastai_docs/blob/master/dev_course/dl2/02a_why_sqrt5.ipynb) demonstrated that this was not quite the case, and the PyTorch team has recently revised the algorithm for calculating Kaiming, removing the $\\sqrt{5}$."

    "It's relatively easy to type out several lines of Python that describe a deep learning model or training regime. Many folks have the tendency to then let sit in perpetuity code that should have only been a v.1 rough draft. Taking the time to refactor our deep learning code will make it easier for others to understand both the fine details and general thrust of our code in one sweep. The habit of refactoring also gives us more modular, extensible code that in turn gives us the freedom to more quickly build on and augment our models.\n",
